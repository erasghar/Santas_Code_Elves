# 🎄 Santa’s Code Elves 🎄

Welcome to Santa's Code Elves! This is a 4-level game where you help Santa Claus with various quests, from house to house, to deliver presents to children! Isn't that wonderful?
Located in the North Pole, Santa is ready to deliver the presents he has, and he will definitely need some help, so come along and help him before the night is over!

The purpose of this project is to learn how to collaborate, share, communicate effectively, and learn all while helping each other out in the best way we can! The Christmas spirit sure is kind, isnt it?
Anyway, throughout this README.md, you will learn about the features of this project, the testing process, the bugs we encountered and were able to fix, the bugs we encountered and unfortunately were not able to fix, the credits to the amazing websites, videos, and resources used to create this game, and what we learnt!
