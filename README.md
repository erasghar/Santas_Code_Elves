# 🎄 Santa’s Code Elves 🎄

Welcome to Santa's Code Elves! This is a 4-level game where you help Santa Claus with various quests, from house to house, to deliver presents to children! Isn't that wonderful?
Located in the North Pole, Santa is ready to deliver the presents he has, and he will definitely need some help, so come along and help him before the night is over!

The purpose of this project is to learn how to collaborate, share, communicate effectively, and learn all while helping each other out in the best way we can! The Christmas spirit sure is kind, isnt it?
Anyway, throughout this README.md, you will learn about the features of this project, the testing process, the bugs we encountered and were able to fix, the bugs we encountered and unfortunately were not able to fix, the credits to the amazing websites, videos, and resources used to create this game, and what we learnt!

# Features! 🎁🎁🎁

**Header of Main Page**

The header of the main page contains the title of the game in a clear and easy-to-see way. Alongside it, the general instructions and the Elves (us, the Code Elves) is seen. The general instructions contain t bullet points telling the viewer how to play the game, while the Elves button contain the amazing contributors to this project!

This section will allow users to remember the title by its eye-catching colours. Not only that, but it will help them understand the game better and give them knowledge over the creators of the game.

**Main Content of the Main Page**

In the main content of the page, the players will see the levels they can access, having Mr.Santa guiding them. The levels which have not been unlocked will have a lock on them until it is unlocked. Furthermore, here you will be able to start the game, entering all levels in a ascending manner, from 1 to 4. In case the player wishes to stop, there is also an "End Game" button.

This section of the game will allow the players to move from level to level with Santa Claus by their side. It will also allow them to start their adventure with Santa and, if needed, to end the game.

**Progress Bar**

The progress bar was added to let the players know how many games they have won and how many are left to help Santa with. This section also contains a small note, telling them in which event this was created and by who. 

The progress bar will help the players in knowing how much of the game they have completed. It will also give them an idea on when and who created this game in case they did not press the "Elves" button.

# FIRST LEVEL! 🎄😈🎅🏻

<img width="794" height="863" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f177905-667b-4936-872a-8a34ba0d7432" />

In the first level, named the "Grinch Hunt Game", the player will interact with everything inside the yellow box. The player receives clear and understandable instructions, along with a timer and the amount of lives (only 1). The game consists on having to click on The Grinch as fast as possible before the time runs out. Make sure you get rid of him, we don't want him ruining Christmas again! Once The Grinch is defeated, a message and a button will pop up, allowing you safe passage back to the main page. There is also a red cross button, which will take the player back to the main page.

The first level shows the player the usual format for the rest of the games. The location of the instructions may vary. It will also tell the player if they have successfuly completed the level, or failed it miserably somehow.

# SECOND LEVEL! 🃏♠️♦️

<img width="701" height="859" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad5218f-7a41-4738-a138-6ff85b64ef53" />

In the second level, named the "Memory Match Game", the player will have the same format as the previous game. In this game, the player will have a few seconds after pressing "start game" to memorize all the cards and match them successfully after they have been flipped. There are 6 matches in total, and if you miss one, you must restart and repeat until you win!

The second level will help the player with their memorization skills, as well as boost cognitive skills like memory, focus, and problem-solving through pattern-reconition.

# THIRD LEVEL! 🎅🏻

**IMAGE**

The third level consists of a maze where the player will have to guide an elf to a present somewhere in the maze. But be careful, each game lost will reset the maze, ehich might make it easier or harder for the player to reach the present. This game has a time limit of 60 seconds. Once the time is over, you will receive a message depending on whether you won or lost.

This level helps the player develop critical cognitive skills like problem-solving, memory, focus, and spatial reasoning, all while teaching planning, persistence, and strategic thinking.

How does it help the player

# Testing Process (emojis)

# Bugs Found and Fixed 🐛😊




Maze Game: In the maze game, the generation for the maze would only appear on one clums of cells and would occupy the whole line, from top to bottom. This was fixed by removing an accidental {}, which had to be placed later after the rows.



#Bugs Found and Not Fixed 🐛😥




Maze Game: In the maze game, the generation for the exit cell has a background image of a present. This image most of the times slightly interpheres with the walls of the grid. It does not affect gameplay, only visual.

# Credits 

emojipedia.org : Helped obtain emojis for the page and README.md
crayion : used for image background in maze
CloudConvert : Converting images to JPG
Youtube : General videos for maze generation in JS
Google search : Image for the present in the maze
EMMETT : Helped find bugs and recommended code used in final result


# What We Learnt

Enrique: I learnt how to properly organize JS code and how important the {} are to keep in order. One mistake with them can result in huge misunderstandings and weird outcomes.


# Final thoughts

Enrique: I really enjoyed the overall experience of this Hackathon. The part I most enjoyed was talking to new people and getting to know their experience. Funny how talking to random strangers can make your day. Taking in consideration this was my first Hackathon, I don't think I could have had a better "veteran"/experienced programmer with us. I learnt a lot and will definitely be participating in another Hackathon in the future!
